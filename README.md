# DISCOMAN - DISCORD PACMAN BOT
A Discord Bot that lets you play Pacman.\
I named it Discoman because I didnt wanted to name it Pacbot :}

**Please give any suggestions to improve it :]**

Made with discord's python api - discord.py

# Commands this bot has
$help - Shows you a list of all commands.

$play - Starts a new game.

$stop - Stops the current game.

Also this game is multiplayer \
So whole server can play together and compete for scores :>

# Self hosting instructions
Download the code.

Create a Discord Bot Application at https://discord.com/developers/applications/, Make sure to enable ALL intents on this page.

Copy the bot's token, open the main.py file with any text editor you like, scroll to the bottom and then you'll find "client.run("TOKEN", reconnect=True)"

Replace TOKEN with the token that you just copied.

Also, on the Discord Bot's Portal,\
go to OAuth2 -> URL Generator and select bot, Administrator and then \
open the Generated Url to add the bot to your server.

Now download Python at https://www.python.org/downloads. \
For Windows, I'll recommend installing from Microsoft store as then it doesn't give path issues.

Now that we've installed Python. \
Open Command Prompt and run "pip install discord.py".

After discord.py is installed, run "pip install tabulate" and finally .

Other than self host, you can also host it on any server if you want.
